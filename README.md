This project will involve the fun of traveling and spinning a wheel! Introducing _Guess & Rest_!

When using this code, you will generate a list that will be filled with multiple vacation sights, such as the Bahamas, the parties of Miami, and so much more!
Once you fill up the list and click the button, a wheel will be generated with all of the selections you have made. Finally, the fun part is **spinning that wheel!**
After spinning, the program takes the location and information to get nearby hotels and create a filter for all your needs, along with the cheapest plane ticket.

This project is helpful for indecisive people who want to have a little bit of fun when choosing their next destination.
